The impact resulted in John suffering multiple breaks to his pelvis and back, a fractured sternum, punctured lungs, a broken arm, and left John a paraplegic.\r\nJohn went on to become the first wheelchair athlete to have completed the famous Hawaii Ironman triathlon and is the first wheelchair athlete to swim the English Channel. He has represented Australia at the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games.   John has set the standard for what is physically possible for a wheelchair athlete. John’s personal mission statement is: “ONLY POSSIBILITIES”. His desire was to expand this mantra beyond himself and help the many children in Australia who require wheelchairs. Therefore he set up the foundation to recognise and encourage each child’s abilities and harness their strengths to achieve extraordinary things on their own terms. JMF is an advocate for the cessation of the word “disability” and believe that is has negative connotations for the development of children with special needs.\r\nI have seen the positive impact that the support provided by JMF can make for kids in wheelchairs and their families.

As an endometriosis sufferer (#1in10), I understand this international health issue and its far reaching physical, social, psychological, economic \u0026 fertility considerations. I believe a new paradigm of health care for endometriosis sufferers needs to be created. A call to encourage health care reform \u0026 improve quality of life outcomes for endometriosis patients. Regrettably, within the present-day health care structure, treatment \u0026 management options are soaked in considerable controversy \u0026 debate still rages over how best to treat \u0026 manage this piercing condition. I believe awareness, education, tick-tock diagnosis, identification, advanced excisional surgical strategies \u0026 surgical support team, as well as a tailored \u0026 effective treatment + long term management program are key ingredients to living better with endometriosis. The Great Southern Crossing Cycling Challenge (SUNCORP) is the perfect challenge, because part of my long term management strategy includes exercise (cycling) + additional strategies. More importantly, I can support Endometriosis Australia whilst pedalling hope. I'm Creative Arts Ambassador for Endometriosis Australia + happy to abandon my poetic quill for one month. We need an injection of #philanthrocapitalism to support ongoing endometriosis research initiatives. The progeny of research considers #datamining for knowledge discovery. Critical issues need to be addressed by the smartest minds in the world. Multiple systems are involved in endometriosis which advanced excisional surgical leaders, scientists \u0026 change agents in the field of endometriosis are just beginning to perceive. I believe the \"cure\" is in the lining of scientific minds and research MUST continue.

I'm very ashamed to admit that the first thing I thought was \"Sam is going to die.\" I was completely ignorant to how far technology has come for cancer battlers, or the success rates. Even with the odd's stacked against Sam due to the severe nature of the cancer, he has still come through - months later - out the other end.\r\n\r\nThis has only been possible because of Foundations like this one, and the people that actually involve themselves to help. We are all so content in our own little bubbles, with our own little lives, that generally when someone that you're not particularly close with receives a diagnosis like this your first reaction is to look up from whatever you're doing and murmur the words \"Oh, that's sad\" before going back to whatever it was you were doing. I was one of those people. It's so sad that we need to have someone close to us go through this, before we're actually motivated to do so something.\r\n\r\nSo I'm imploring with you. Don't keep being that person. Any amount goes such a long way, further than you think. That $5 you just spent on your large coffee? That could save someone's brother/sister/mother/father's ife. \r\n\r\nClick the \"Give Now\" button and feel like a star for the rest of the day! :)","image":{"original_image_url":"https://deplyv9vomqtj.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1251576/original/blob-1ee787d02c8aba140344e83e9c93c756.","tiny_image_url":"https://deplyv9vomqtj.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1251576/tiny/blob-1ee787d02c8aba140344e83e9c93c756.","small_image_url":"https://deplyv9vomqtj.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1251576/small/blob-1ee787d02c8aba140344e83e9c93c756.","medium_image_url":"https://deplyv9vomqtj.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1251576/medium/blob-1ee787d02c8aba140344e83e9c93c756.","large_image_url":"https://deplyv9vomqtj.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1251576/large/blob-1ee787d02c8aba140344e83e9c93c756.","extra_large_image_url":"https://deplyv9vomqtj.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1251576/extra_large/blob-1ee787d02c8aba140344e83e9c93c756."},"created_at":"2015-10-25T21:45:49.000Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T04:48:07.000Z","url":"https://greatsoutherncrossing.everydayhero.com/au/april","campaign_name":"The Great Southern Crossing","charity_name":"Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland","team_page_id":1249655,"invitation_id":187768,"coordinate":{"lat":-27.5,"lon":152.97}},{"id":1242372,"slug":"edan","gift_aid_eligible":false,"charity_uid":"au-223","campaign_uid":"au-19283","owner_uid":"1277309","owner_type":"User","uid":1242372,"state":"active","target_cents":100000,"name":"Edan","team_uid":109316,"team_member_uids":[],"team_leader_page_uid":null,"expires_at":"2015-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","amount":{"cents":31650,"currency":{"iso_code":"AUD","name":"Australian Dollar","symbol":"$"}},"cached_offline_amount_cents":0,"campaign_date":null,"fitness_activity_overview":{"bike":{"duration_in_seconds":248657,"calories":0,"distance_in_meters":1534779}},"story":"This November, my cycling team and I are aiming to virtually cycle 5,200km – the distance across Australia - in The Great Southern Crossing.

No one could tell us when she was going to come out of her diabetic coma or if or what love long term damage might of developed as a result!!\r\n\r\nAs all parents, I would do anything to take this from her and the anxiety my wife and I feel each and every day especially first thing in the morning when we wake up and first thing go into her room to make sure our little girl now 9 is still alive!\r\n\r\nSo I am left with hope for the future by raising money for research and most importantly to raise money for support centers to help families like us so we know we are not alone. The Telthon Centre does just that, supports families, provides education and resources and most importantly connects children that can relate to each other and share their experiences!\r\n\r\nPlease help me by donating to the great southern crossing ride every dollar counts!!","image":{"original_image_url":"https://dm5ei4oosl5j.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1240721/original/image-5967e17e0dbeee069fb50bd828fcff54.jpeg","tiny_image_url":"https://dm5ei4oosl5j.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1240721/tiny/image-5967e17e0dbeee069fb50bd828fcff54.jpeg","small_image_url":"https://dm5ei4oosl5j.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1240721/small/image-5967e17e0dbeee069fb50bd828fcff54.jpeg","medium_image_url":"https://dm5ei4oosl5j.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1240721/medium/image-5967e17e0dbeee069fb50bd828fcff54.jpeg","large_image_url":"https://dm5ei4oosl5j.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1240721/large/image-5967e17e0dbeee069fb50bd828fcff54.jpeg","extra_large_image_url":"https://dm5ei4oosl5j.cloudfront.net/pages/images/1240721/extra_large/image-5967e17e0dbeee069fb50bd828fcff54.jpeg"},"created_at":"2015-10-14T12:32:24.000Z","updated_at":"2015-11-24T06:47:41.000Z","url":"https://greatsoutherncrossing.everydayhero.com/au/bart","campaign_name":"The Great Southern Crossing","charity_name":"Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre","team_page_id":1238561,"invitation_id":null,"coordinate":null},{"id":1252539,"slug":"amy","gift_aid_eligible":false,"charity_uid":"au-1534","campaign_uid":"au-19283","owner_uid":"1286433","owner_type":"User","uid":1252539,"state":"active","target_cents":100000,"name":"Amy","team_uid":110037,"team_member_uids":[],"team_leader_page_uid":null,"expires_at":"2015-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","amount":{"cents":23150,"currency":{"iso_code":"AUD","name":"Australian Dollar","symbol":"$"}},"cached_offline_amount_cents":0,"campaign_date":null,"fitness_activity_overview":{"bike":{"duration_in_seconds":157698,"calories":12837,"distance_in_meters":361121}},"story":"This November, my cycling team and I are aiming to virtually cycle 5,200km – the distance across Australia - in The Great Southern Crossing.

That’s 5,200 kms!\r\nIn the first week was able to do over 320kms, and hope to do well over 1,200 for the month.\r\n\r\nTogether, my team and I are aiming to raise $10,000 for The Song Room, a really important charity which provides Aussie kids with the opportunity to participate in music and the arts to enhance their education, personal development and community involvement.  3 in 4 Australian kids do not have music in their schools, despite the irrefutable evidence that kids who participate in music and the arts at school increase their educational outcomes. The Song Room works really hard to cover this service so that disadvantaged kids can reach their full potential.\r\n\r\nI’d be very grateful if you would support me and my fellow riders in the ambitious event.
