The Family Centre is here to help. We provide peer and psychosocial support, education and information, to kids with type 1 and their families. \r\n\r\nEvery member of our team is impacted by type 1 diabetes. Three of our riders live with type 1. Two of our riders are Diabetes Dads. \r\n\r\nRiding this far is no small feat for people impacted by type 1. We're juggling insulin doses, carbohydrate counting, and energy expenditures and trying to keep our blood glucose levels safe and stable throughout. The Diabetes Dads on the team are looking after their type 1 kids, often throughout the night, and then they get up in the morning and ride. \r\n\r\nWe have skin in the game. We are here to show the kids in our type 1 community that they can do anything they set their minds to. We are determined, strong, and ready to ride!
